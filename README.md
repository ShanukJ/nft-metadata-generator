> A simple script to generate metadata for NFTs. You can generate generic metadata or dynamic metadata using this script.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
node index.js
```

Add your attributes into attributes.json file. You can add one or attributes for every image. Thanks [@Granjalf](https://github.com/Granjalf) for adding this feature.

If you want to generate unrevealed metadata for a collection you can remove dynamic url of the image and replace it with unrevealed image url.

You can remove the attributes if you don't want to add traits and values'
